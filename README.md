The code presented here can make any motor travel the angle (in degrees) entered if their angular speed is present.
There is no feedback, so the reference angle position is not set. The example code represents an open-loop system. 
So the information about the angle position is lost when the power is off. It can be improved by using rotary encoders' feedback, or my mind says that using EEPROM can also work.

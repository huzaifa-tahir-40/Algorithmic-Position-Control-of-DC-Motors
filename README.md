The code presented here can make any motor travel the angle (in degrees) entered.
The focus of the MG996R_control.ino file is to make the continuous rotation servo motor MG996R travel an angle in degrees.
There is no feedback, so the reference angle position is not set. The code in MG996R_control.ino represents an open-loop system.
